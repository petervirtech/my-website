My personal multilingual website
Peter Kraus - Website
Netlify Status

https://www.virtech.nl

This is my personal website. It was made using [11ty](https://11ty.dev/), [decapCMS](https://decapcms.org) and [netlify](https://netlify.app) .

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build the site in the `public` directory.

## Serve

```bash
npm start
```

This will do the same as `npm run build`, and run 11ty's built-in web server.
